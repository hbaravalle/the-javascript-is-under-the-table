        <p>What is thy bidding, my master? There is a great disturbance in the Force. I have felt it. We have a new enemy - Luke Skywalker. Yes, my master. He could destroy us. He's just a boy. Obi-Wan can no longer help him. The Force is strong
          with him. The son of Skywalker must not become a Jedi. If he could be turned, he would become a powerful ally. Yes. Yes. He would be a great asset. Can it be done? He will join us or die, my master.</p>
        <p>Come on! You want me to stay because of the way you feel about me. Yes. You're a great help to us. You're a natural leader... No! That's not it. Come on. Aahhh - uh huh! Come on. You're imagining things. Am I? Then why are you following
          me? Afraid I was going to leave without giving you a goodbye kiss? I'd just as soon kiss a Wookiee. I can arrange that. You could use a good kiss!</p>
        <p>But that down. Hey! That's my dinner. How you get so big, eating food of this kind? Listen, friend, we didn't mean to land in that puddle, and if we could get our ship out, we would, but we can't, so why don't you just... Aww, cannot get
          your ship out? Hey, you could have broken this. Don't do that. Ohhh...you're making a mess. Hey, give me that! Mine! Or I will help you not. don't want your help. I want my lamp back. I'll need it to get out of this slimy mudhole. Mudhole?
          Slimy? My home this is. Ah, ah, ah! Oh, Artoo, let him have it. Mine! Mine! Artoo! Mine! Mine!</p>
        <p>Well, Your Highness, I guess this is it. That's right. Well, don't get all mushy on me. So long, Princess. Han! Yes, Your Highnessness? I thought you decided to stay. Well, the bounty hunter we ran into on Ord Mantell changed my mind.
          Han, we need you! We? Yes. Oh, what about you need? I need? I don't know what you're talking about. You probably don't. And what precisely am I supposed to know? </p>
        <p>Ready for some power? Okay. Let's see now. Put that in there. There you go. Now all I have to do is find this Yoda...if he even exists. Still...there's something familiar about this place. I feel like...I don't know... Like we're being
          watched! Away with your weapon! I mean you no harm. I am wondering, why are you here? I'm looking for someone. Looking? Found someone, you have, I would say, hmmm? Right. Help you I can. Yes, mmmm. don't think so. I'm looking for a great
          warrior. Ahhh! A great warrior. Wars not make one great.</p>
        <p>So was I, if you'll remember. He is too old. Yes, too old to begin the training. But I've learned so much. Will he finished what he begins? I won't fail you - I'm not afraid. Oh, you will be. You will be.</p>
        <p>Hey, Your Worship, I'm only trying to help. Would you please stop calling me that? Sure, Leia. Oh, you make it so difficult sometimes. I do, I really do. You could be a little nicer, though. Come on, admit it. Sometimes you think I'm all
          right. Occasionally maybe...when you aren't acting like a scoundrel. Scoundrel? Scoundrel? I like the sound of that. Stop that. Stop what? Stop that! My hands are dirty. My hands are dirty, too. What are you afraid of? Afraid? You're
          trembling. I'm not trembling.</p>
        <p>All troop carriers will assemble at the north entrance. The heavy transport ships will leave as soon as they're loaded. Only two fighter escorts per ship. The energy shield can only be opened for a short time, so you'll have to stay very
          close to your transports. Two fighters against a Star Destroyer? The ion cannon will fire several shots to make sure that any enemy ships will be out of your flight path. When you've gotten past the energy shield, proceed directly to the
          rendezvous point. Understood? Right. Okay. Good luck. Okay. Everyone to your stations. Let's go!</p>
        <p>Look, I'm sure it's delicious. I just don't understand why we can't see Yoda now. Patience! For the Jedi it is time to eat as well. Eat, eat. Hot. Good food, hm? Good, hmm? How far away is Yoda? Will it take us long to get there? Not far.
          Yoda not far. Patience. Soon you will be with him. Rootleaf, I cook. Why wish you become Jedi? Hm? Mostly because of my father, I guess. Ah, your father. Powerful Jedi was he, powerful Jedi, mmm. </p>
        <p>Their primary target will be the power generators. Prepare to open the shield. Sir, Rebel ships are coming into our sector. Good. Our first catch of the day. Stand by, ion control....Fire! The first transport is away.</p>
        <p>Lord Vader, the fleet has moved out of light-speed, and we're preparing to...Aaagh! You have failed me for the last time, Admiral. Captain Piett. Yes, my lord. Make ready to land out troops beyond the energy shield and deploy the fleet so
          that nothing gets off that system. You are in command now, Admiral Piett. Thank you, Lord Vader.</p>
        <p>I don't know where you get you delusions, laser brain.</p>
        <p>Laugh it up, fuzz ball. But you didn't see us alone in the south passage. She expressed her true feelings for me. My...! Why, you stuck up...half-witted...scruffy-looking...nerf-herder! Who's scruffy-looking? I must have hit her pretty
          close to the mark to get her all riled up like that, huh, kid? Why, I guess you don't know everything about women yet? Headquarters personnel, report to command center. Take it easy. Excuse us, please.</p>
        <p>Artoo! You be more careful. Artoo - that way! Artoo! Oh, no! Are you all right? Come on. You're lucky you don't taste very good. Anything broken? If you're saying coming here was a bad idea, I'm beginning to agree with you. Oh, Artoo,
          what are we doing here? It's like... something out of a dream, or, I don't know. Maybe I'm just going crazy.</p>
        <p>General, I've got to leave. I can't stay anymore. I'm sorry to hear that. Well, there's a price on my head. If I don't pay off Jabba the Hut, I'm a dead man. A death mark's not an easy thing to live with. You're a good fighter, Solo. I
          hate to lose you. Thank you, General.</p>
        <p>Echo Base...I've got something! Not much, but it could be a life form. This is Rouge Two. this is Rouge Two. Captain Solo, so you copy? Commander Skywalker, do you copy? This is Rouge Two. Good morning. Nice of you guys to drop by. Echo
          Base...this is Rouge Two. I found them. Repeat, I found them. Master Luke, sir, it's good to see you fully functional again.</p>
        <p>Let go. Sshh! et go, please. Don't get excited. Captain, being held by you isn't quite enough to get me excited. Sorry, sweetheart. We haven't got time for anything else.</p>
        <p>Steady, Rouge Two Activate harpoon. Good shot, Janson. One more pass. Coming around. Once more. One more. Cable out! Let her go! Detach cable. Cable detached. Come on! Whooha!! That got him! I see it, Wedge. Good work. I don't think we
          can protect two transports at a time. It's risky, but we can't hold out much longer. We have no choice. Launch patrols. Evacuate remaining ground staff. No, no! No! This one goes there, that one goes there. right? Artoo, you take good care
          of Master Luke now, understand? And...do take care of yourself. Oh, dear, oh, dear.</p>
